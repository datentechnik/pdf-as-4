verify.value.0=The value of the signature has been verified successfully.
verify.value.1=An error has occurred while verifying the value of the signature.

verify.cert.0=It was possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate. Each certificate in this chain is valid at the check time specified in the request.
verify.cert.1=It was not possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate.
verify.cert.2=It was possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate. The check time for at least one certificate in this chain is outside the period of validity.
verify.cert.3=It was possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate. The check time for all certificates in this chain is within the validity period. It was not possible to determine the certificate status for at least one certificate.
verify.cert.4=It was possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate. The check time for all certificates in this chain is within the validity period. At least one certificate is revoked at the check time.
verify.cert.5=It was possible to construct a formally correct certificate chain from the signatory certificate to a trustworthy root certificate. The check time for all certificates in this chain is within the validity period. None of the certificates in this chain is revoked at the check time. At least one certificate is disabled at the check time.
verify.cert.99=The signature verification data has not been checked as an error has occurred while checking the validity of the signature.
